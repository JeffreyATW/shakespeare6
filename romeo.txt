Romeo and Juliet
by William Shakespeare

In fair Verona, where we lay our scene...

SOME GUY: I bite my thumb at you.

HENRY VIII: Once more into the breach, dear friends. Whoops I'm in the wrong play

JULIET: Ay, me.

ROMEO: What light from yonder window breaks?

ROMEO: Wherefore art thou?

TYBALT: A plague on both your houses.

JULIET: Oh I drank poison (or did I stab myself? I forget) and I'm dead now.

THE END

Epilogue: They come back from the dead
